# The MegaFIR
 
## Introduction
The MegaFIR was hte original concept of this no-touch-thermometer project. The ideas was for everyone with a soldering iron and a credit card to be able to build a fever triage thermometer. This is how it currently looks like in pretotyping. Feel free to check the [Electrical Diagram](https://github.com/MakeInBelgium/No-Touch-IR-Thermometer/blob/master/Mega_FIR/MegaFIR_ElectricalDiagram.md) document and the [Build of Materials (BoM)](https://github.com/MakeInBelgium/No-Touch-IR-Thermometer/blob/master/Mega_FIR/MegaFIR_BoM.md).
